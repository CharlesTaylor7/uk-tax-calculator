ðŸ—‚ Project Plan

Phase 1: Requirements and Design
	â€¢	Review full tax band logic and sample data.
	â€¢	Define system requirements and edge cases.
	â€¢	Create high-level architecture diagram.
	â€¢	Decide on relevant design patterns (e.g., Strategy for tax calculation, Factory for tax bands).

Phase 2: Core Implementation
	â€¢	Define tax band model (with lower, upper, rate).
	â€¢	Implement tax calculator:
	â€¢	Accepts salary input
	â€¢	Computes tax per band
	â€¢	Returns total tax
	â€¢	Add input validation and error handling.

Phase 3: Testing and Frameworks
	â€¢	Unit tests for tax calculation logic.
	â€¢	Integration tests for application flow.
	â€¢	(Optional) Use xUnit/NUnit and FluentAssertions.
	â€¢	Mocking strategies with Moq (if needed).

Phase 4: Documentation & Submission
	â€¢	Document architecture decisions.
	â€¢	Explain design pattern choices.
	â€¢	Mention third-party libraries/frameworks used.
	â€¢	Package code in a GitHub repo or ZIP file.

Would you like me to help design the class structure or write a sample implementation outline next?Â ï¿¼
