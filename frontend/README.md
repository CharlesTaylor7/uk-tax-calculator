# TaxCalculator Frontend

This is the frontend for the UK Tax Calculator application, built with Angular and managed using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.

## Development Server

To start the local development server, run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

Note: The backend server must also be running for API requests to function correctly. The development server is configured to proxy API calls to the backend.

## Other Commands

To lint the code with ESLint:

```
npm run lint
```

To format the code with Prettier:

```
npm run format
```
